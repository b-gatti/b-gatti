Curious, analytical, and data-driven. I bring a strong foundation in mathematics and economics, and I'm pivoting from academia to apply my skills in real-world research and analytics. My projects showcase experience with Python, pandas, and data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn. Iâ€™m exploring opportunities in data analysis, research, and adjacent fields. Open to learning, collaborating, and building solutions that make an impact.
