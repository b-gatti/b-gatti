Analytical thinker with a strong foundation in mathematics, now applying those skills to real-world data problems. My projects showcase experience with Python, pandas, and data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn. Iâ€™m exploring opportunities in data analysis, research, and adjacent fields like clinical data and project management. Open to learning, collaborating, and building solutions that make an impact.
